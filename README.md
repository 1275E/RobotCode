`git add -A`

This gathers all the files that you have created/deleted/edited.

`git commit -m "thoughful message"`

This command stages you changes and tacks on the message to let other contibuters know whats happening and why you made these changes.

`git push`

This pushed the changes to github.

## Updating Your Copy of the Code ##
Run the command `git pull` and then `git merge` to update your code.

## Note ##
The only files that should be of interest are the `/src/` files. Editing the other files is not advised as they are dependencies.
